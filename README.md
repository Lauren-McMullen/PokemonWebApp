# Welcome to our Pokemon Model Web Application!

Hi there! This Pokemon project was developed over two weeks by a team of 4th year computer science students at the University of British Columbia. This web application is an exploration of using relational databases in a Node/Express application. This project challenged the developers to grow their backend development skills over a tight deadline. 

Our goal with this project was to create several webpages that connect with a relational database to model some basic user actions that occur within the pokemon video game franchise.

## üñ•Ô∏è Tech Stack

This Pokemon web Application was developed using:
- Vanilla JavaScript
- HTML/CSS for frontend 
- Node.js
- Express
- Oracale and SQL

# Pokemon Pages üåøüî•üíß

Currently, we cannot offer a live demo set as the database has not been set up on a remote server. Due to the nature of the project, proper password encryption is not implemented. Thus, we hope the following photos and gifs can provide a full picture of our application behaviour.
